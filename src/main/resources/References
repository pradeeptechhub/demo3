Notes:
@ModelAttributes get placed within the model when used on a stand alone method.
@ModelAttributes is used to map form data to model attributes when used as a method parameter.
@SessionAttributes is applicable to single controller only.

Spring MVC Questions:
Que01. What is flashAttribute and why do we use it?
Ans: You can use RedirectAttributes to store flash attributes and they will be automatically propagated to the "output" FlashMap of the current request.
A RedirectAttributes model is empty when the method is called and is never used unless the method returns a redirect view name or a RedirectView.
After the redirect, flash attributes are automatically added to the model of the controller that serves the target URL.
